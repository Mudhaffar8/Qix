This game was developed as part of the CPS406 - Intro to Software Engineering project during sprint 3.

mQIX is a single-player game where players draw lines to capture areas within the arena while avoiding Sparx and Qix, enemies that move along the arenaâ€™s edges and within its bounds. The goal of the game is to capture a set percentage of the arena, whether it be 50%, 75% or 80%, without being hit by the enemies.
